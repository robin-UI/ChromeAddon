    In software, a stack overflow occurs when too much memory is used on the call stack. The call stack contains a
    limited amount of memory, often determined at the start of the program. The size of the call stack depends on many
    factors, including the programming language, machine architecture, multi-threading, and amount of available memory.
    When too much memory is used on the call stack the stack is said to overflow, typically resulting in a program
    crash.[1] This class of software bug is usually caused by one of two types of programming errors.[2]
